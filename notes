// everything in react is a component

// attributes tell the tag what to render/do/expect
// <img src="dog.jpg" alt="Dog">
// <input type="text">

// Same with React components, but they're called PROPS - props are the way we get data into a component
// Props is how the data gets to where it needs to go (like the car)
// State is the data's home

// Helper functions (JS not React specific)
